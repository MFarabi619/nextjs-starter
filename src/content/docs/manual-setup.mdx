import { File, Folder, Files } from "fumadocs-ui/components/files";

## Steps

You can either start with a folder, or let the Fumadocs command create one for you.

Option 1: Make a directory, and navigate to it.

Once you're in your desired directory, run the Fumadocs quick start command:

```bash
pnpm create fumadocs-app
```

Let it install with the default name. Copy everything from that directory into your root directory, then delete that directory.

Option 2: Just run the command, and when prompted, pick the name. It doesn't make it a Git repo by default, so you'll have to initialize it.

Navigate into the directory, then run the following then navigate to `localhost:3000` to check if it works.

```bash
pnpm i; pnpm dev
```

As the time of writing this, Fumadocs creates a Next.js app with the `app` directory at the root level, and does not provide the option to use the `src` directory, which would be provided by the Next.js CLI.

Therefore, we need to manually move the `app` directory into the `src` directory, and then make some pathing changes in various files.

Create a `src` directory at the root level, and move the `app` and `content` directories into it. At this point, your project structure should look like this:

<Files>
  <Folder name="src" defaultOpen>
    <Folder name="app" defaultOpen>
      <Folder name="api" defaultOpen></Folder>
      <Folder name="docs" defaultOpen>
        <Folder name="[[...slug]]">
          <File name="page.tsx" />
        </Folder>
        <File name="layout.tsx" />
        <File name="global.css" />
      </Folder>
    </Folder>
  </Folder>
  <File name="package.json" />
  <File name="other config files...." />
</Files>

Make the following changes:

`paths` key in `tsconfig.json`.

```diff json title="tsconfig.json"
"paths": {
-  "@/*": ["./*"],
+  "@/*": ["./src/*"], // [!code highlight]
+  "@root/*": ["./*"], // [!code highlight]
}
```
