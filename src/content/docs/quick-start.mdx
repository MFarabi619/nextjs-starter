## Steps

Currently the project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as the package manager. If you do not have it, you can install it via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```bash
npm i -g pnpm
```

Clone [the repository](https://github.com/mfarabi619/nextjs-starter/) to your machine.

```bash
# Via HTTPS
git clone https://github.com/MFarabi619/nextjs-starter.git
# Or via SSH
git clone git@github.com:MFarabi619/nextjs-starter.git
# Or via GitHub CLI
gh repo clone MFarabi619/nextjs-starter
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd nextjs-starter
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm i
```

Run development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open `localhost:3000` in your browser to see the result.
