> Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.

## Steps

Currently the project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as the package manager. If you do not have it, you can install it via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```bash
npm i -g pnpm
```

Clone [the repository](https://github.com/mfarabi619/stack-builder/) to your machine.

```bash
# Via HTTPS
git clone https://github.com/MFarabi619/stack-builder.git
# Or via SSH
git clone git@github.com:MFarabi619/stack-builder.git
# Or via GitHub CLI
gh repo clone MFarabi619/stack-builder
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd stack-builder
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm i
```

Run development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open `localhost:3000` in your browser to see the result.
